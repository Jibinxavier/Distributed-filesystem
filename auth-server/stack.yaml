# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
# resolver: ghcjs-0.1.0_ghc-7.10.2
# resolver:
#  name: custom-snapshot
#  location: "./custom-snapshot.yaml"
resolver: lts-7.12

docker:
  enable: true # warning!

# stack image container
image:
  container:
    name: authserver
    base: distr-filesystem-base

# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver
# (e.g., acme-missiles-0.3)
packages:
  - '.'
  - '../filesystem-api'
